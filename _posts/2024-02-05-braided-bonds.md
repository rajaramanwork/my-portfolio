I admire the innocenceI admire the innocence <br>
Behind friendship bracelets.<br>
I admire how each color <br>
Can signify the most simple aspects<br>
Of young <br>
 friendship<br>
And platonic love. <br>

I admire how each bead is different,<br>
How each bracelet can be built different, <br>
Some are unstable,<br>
Some are very strong,<br>
Some are simply built on elastic string<br>
And yarn.<br>
How the material <br>
Can represent the<br>
 type of people they are. <br>

I admire the irony behind them.<br>
The twisting and turning <br>
In yarn string when they <br>
Create new designs.<br>
Some going in the direction<br>
Of an arrowhead <br>
piercing through the flesh<br>
Of the bravest warriors. <br>
Some braided<br>
In comparison to rapunzel <br>
As she escapes from her <br>
Tower of confinement.<br>

The field of static,<br>
Flyaway fabric fibers<br>
A common field<br>
Of grass at recess in second grade<br>
Where a bond is created<br>
Between a pair of two<br>
Individuals, children.<br>

I admire how the designs<br>
Can replicate the ways<br>
Of one’s friendship.<br>
How the physical makeup<br>
Of one’s character<br>
Can be condensed, brought to one,<br>
knotted reminder of home.<br>
