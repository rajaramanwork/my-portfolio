Through ashes,<br>
I venture,<br>
through blood,<br>
I rush.<br>
Through torch,<br>
I burn,<br>
I seek for oil,<br>
to keep me going.<br>

I slowly simmer down,<br>
so different races,<br>
may walk freely.<br>
Voices,<br>
ones that were the quietest,<br>
harmonize,<br>
to the loudest. <br>
That is, <br>
until it was,<br>
too late.<br>

Blue fire,<br>
lit across a matchstick.<br>
When,<br>
the time came,<br>
to the end,<br>
hopes,<br>
dreams,<br>
and self-confidence,<br>
built from ground zero,<br>
for several years,<br>
annihilate,<br>
within seconds.<br>

Funny, <br>
like weird,<br>
how the longest things,<br>
to arrive,<br>
are the quickest,<br>
to leave.<br>
