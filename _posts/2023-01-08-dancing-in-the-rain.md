I was 7.<br>
the rain caressed,<br>
my lips,<br>
and my exposed shoulders,<br>
my yellow,<br>
tank top,<br>
drenched in water,<br>
outshone the gloomy sky,<br>
of the July evening.<br>

The wet mud,<br>
that lay in front of my<br>
driveway<br>
squished,<br>
and smuggled,<br>
through each of my little,<br>
toes.<br>

The earthworms,<br>
emerged from their,<br>
mushroom top homes,<br>
their, <br>
grassy hilltop burrows,<br>
and the,<br>
soil in which,<br>
mossy tree stocks,<br>
sew through,<br>
like brown,<br>
dusty fabrics you would find,<br>
in an abandoned quilt factory.<br>

Tiny sprouts,<br>
of little waterfalls,<br>
and intricate bulbs,<br>
of water,<br>
dive <br>
	
Tiny beads,<br>
of perspiration,<br>
cluster and navigate through,<br>
the maze of spaces,<br>
between each pore,<br>
and hair,<br>
of arm.<br>

Us mortals,<br>
dance through,<br>
freely,<br>
so that the sorrow within,<br>
is transferred,<br>

The dark circles,<br>
of seclusion,<br>
and,<br>
despondency,<br>
are eradicated from my soul,<br>
until the,<br>
storms of a salty sea,<br>
wails of mother nature herself,<br>
stop flowing. <br>
until the rainbow,<br>
of,<br>
faint crimson,<br>
obscured lightning orange,<br>
pale yellow,<br>
muzzy lime, <br>
and,<br>
fluorescent cyan,<br>
bridge past the ashy clouds,<br>
and the emerging sun.<br>
