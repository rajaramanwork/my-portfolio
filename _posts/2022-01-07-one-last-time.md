One last time.<br>
One last time,<br>
may I walk downtown,<br> 
watch rain clouds,<br>
drown the sky,<br>
among hidden stars,<br> 
and the sun. <br>
Just one last time.<br>

One last time<br>
may I see<br>
skin color - and race,<br> 
not speak,<br>
 louder than actions.<br>

One last time,<br>
may I see the charred - dark sky,<br>
fade into silver light, <br>
as the angels above, <br>
have mercy upon my soul. <br>
Just one last time. <br>

One last time, <br>
may I feel God's breath, <br>
 stroke my face, <br>
rain tumbles, <br>
across a road <br>
only led by wind. <br>
Just one last time.<br>

One last time, <br>
may I walk,<br>
through barren quicksand, <br>
where panic, <br>
leads to my death. <br>
Just one last time. <br>

One last time, <br>
may I sail a boat,<br>
across a sea of ignorance, <br>
and possible hope.<br>
may I see the blank space of blue, <br>
stare into my hopeless eyes. <br>
Feeding on my anxiety, <br>
 and frustration.  <br>
Just one last time.<br>

One last time, <br>
may I hear the world, <br>
judge my skin. <br>
may I plea to god, <br>
“Make the world change”.<br>
Just one last time. <br>

One last time, <br>
may I hear people call,<br> 
“Are you okay?”<br>
“Stop choking him!”<br>
“Don’t kill that man!”<br>

One last time.<br>

When?<br>
when will,<br>
people’s hearts,<br>
and mindless souls,<br>
respond to our black voices?<br> 

One last time, <br>
may I watch my children,<br>
leap into my arms.<br>

When,<br>
when will they live,<br>
in the land of free.<br>
When will,<br>
kids of all races,<br>
sing the anthem,<br>
true.<br>

For the first time.<br>
