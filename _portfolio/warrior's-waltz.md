I listen to songs and melodies escaping <br>
from the speaker connected to my phone<br>
as I work on my final math problems.<br>
In the corner of my eye,<br>
I witness a groggy, injured wasp's walk.<br>

I watch as it drags its yellow leg<br>
across the thick, dense carpet,<br>
much like a soldier on a battlefield,<br>
fighting its way through obstacles.<br>
The loose carpet fur coils around it,<br>
like plant tendrils around dead wood.<br>

A ball of anger, it moves like pebbles<br>
by a pond, carried downstream<br>
with the motions of wind and water.<br>
Its calmness is mesmerizing,<br>
yet it's almost in a panic,<br>
navigating through a new field, a prairie,<br>
an empty field of chaos.<br>

Like a soldier at war, running from everyone<br>
and no one,<br>
it maneuvers through wedges and edges<br>
in the folds of rugged fabric,<br>
combing every crumb, tasting,<br>
each decision,<br>
 a matter of life and death.<br>

It becomes a source of shade, like a traveler<br>
in a canyon's atrium, relying on open rivers<br>
for direction,<br>
rivers contaminated by dirt, dust,<br>
and rocks the size of grains of rice.<br>

It climbs up a chair, slipping along metal's grease<br>
and black tack,<br>
victorious in its final ascent,<br>
looking over the canyon's edge,<br>
ensuring its disorientation.<br>

Its wings lift as it prepares to leave,<br>
defying its greatest fear,<br>
and taking flight over the ground.<br>
